# Low-cost, portable and power efficient ECG Signal Analysis and Heartbeat sound Acquisition System for Cardiac Assessment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a low-cost, portable, and power-efficient ECG signal analysis and heartbeat monitoring system. Designed for real-time cardiac assessment, the system leverages a **Dual-MCU architecture** and **TinyML** to classify cardiac rhythms directly on the device with clinical-grade accuracy. By capturing both electrical (ECG) and acoustic (PCG) physiological signatures, it provides a comprehensive, cloud-independent point-of-care diagnostic tool.

### The Problem
Traditional ECG monitoring equipment is often expensive, stationary, and focused on a single parameter. While cloud-based IoT solutions exist, they suffer from data privacy vulnerabilities, high power consumption, latency, and absolute dependency on active internet connectivity, making them unviable for remote areas or frontline health screening.

### The Solution
By utilizing **Edge Computing**, this device processes raw ECG and PCG data locally. It eliminates cloud latency, ensures data privacy, runs advanced noise cancellation, and performs real-time machine learning inference for arrhythmia classification entirely offline.

### 1. Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
* **50 Hz Notch Filter (ECG):** Removes powerline AC hum from the environment. Implemented on the STM32 via an **81-tap FIR configuration** with a stopband window spanning `48 Hz - 52 Hz`.
* **40 Hz Low-Pass Filter (ECG):** Attenuates high-frequency muscle contractions and baseline artifact wander using an **81-tap low-pass filter** cutting off strictly at `40 Hz` to preserve the vital QRS complex.
* **200 Hz Low-Pass Filter (PCG):** Blocks environmental cross-talk while passing the primary **"lub-dub" (S1/S2)** structural heart sounds via an **81-tap architecture** operating at a `1000 Hz` sampling rate.
* **Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC):** Leverages a dual-microphone framework. One MAX4466 is encapsulated within the stethoscope chest piece, while a second standalone MAX4466 samples ambient noise to apply dynamic subtraction filtering.
* **Pan-Tompkins Algorithm:** Executes real-time derivative squaring, moving-window integration, and an adaptive thresholding pipeline to isolate individual R-peaks for accurate heart rate calculation.

### 2. TinyML Inference Configuration
* **Dataset & Augmentation:** Trained on the standard **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**. The training profiles were balanced using target noise injection, including Gaussian noise additions ($\sigma = 0.005-0.02$), random scaling ($85\% - 115\%$), and time-shifting to balance classes evenly.
* **Target Classes:** Real-time multi-class classification tracking:
  * **Normal Sinus Rhythm (N)**
  * **Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)**
  * **Atrial Flutter (AFL)**
  * **Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC)**
* **Edge Quantization:** Full post-training integer-quantization reduces model allocation size, allowing it to execute within a sub-**60KB RAM** arena inside the ESP32's TFLite Micro runtime environment.

---

## 📈 Evaluation & Results
* **High-Fidelity Waves:** Clean real-time ECG trace tracking and dynamic R-peak detection plots rendered directly to the local display module.
* **Validated Classification:** Proven capability to isolate high-probability events on edge devices (e.g., identifying Atrial Fibrillation anomalies with distinct confidence index values during testing loops).
* **Power Savings:** Successfully triggers ultra-low-power idle states via the collaborative inter-MCU sleep timer loop, instantly waking on any button-based hardware interrupt.
